	/// DefineShapeTag defines a shape to be displayed.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>
	/// The shape defines a path containing a mix of straight and curved 
	/// edges and pen move actions. A path need not be contiguous. 
	/// When the shape is drawn the ShapeStyle object selects the line 
	/// and fill styles, from the respective array, to be used. 
	/// ShapeStyle objects can be defined in the shape at any time to 
	/// change the styles being used. The fill style used can either be 
	/// a solid color, a bitmap image or a gradient. The line style 
	/// specifies the color and thickness of the line drawn around 
	/// the shape outline.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// For both line and fill styles the selected style may be undefined, 
	/// allowing the shape to be drawn without an outline or left unfilled.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>
	/// This tag was introduced in Flash 1.
